### Hello, bonjour, buenos días, bom día, こんにちは! 👋

  <summary> <b>About&nbsp;Me&nbsp;ℹ️&nbsp;</b></summary>
  <br/>

Originally, I started out as a musician and a guitar teacher, and I played in a relatively busy rock band for 10 years in London. During my years in the band, I also worked in food retail, finance, customer service and sales either as a manager, a salesman or as a customer and support advisor.

After turning for good the music chapter of my life at the end of 2019, the need for a career change, creativity and learning new things led me to studying web development.
  
I started studying web development part-time, after work and during my weekends, in May 2020. And a year later, I quit my job to study web development full time.
  
Fast forward to March 2022, I landed my first junior developer role at PageSuite in Ashford where I started learning and working with Angular, Sencha Touch, C#, AWS and more.

  <summary> <b>What I've been studying 🌱</b></summary>
  <br/>
  
At first I wanted to only focus on studying HTML, CSS, Sass and JavaScript, but the more I was learning the more I discovered new things and developed a genuine interest for frontend and backend technologies such as React, NodeJS, APIs and the MERN stack in general. 
  
Recently I've added Angular to my studying routine since my junior developer role at PageSuite involves using Angular.

  <summary> <b>What I'm currently working on 🔨</b></summary>
  <br/>
  
In my spare time I'm building MERN projects and websites to put in practice what I learn every day at work or in my self studying time, and I'm hoping to finish working very soon on the instagram clone I've recently started building from scratch using React, Next.js, Firebase, Tailwind.css and more!

  <summary> <b>Why I should be considered as a candidate 🙂</b></summary>
  <br/>

Despite not having a degree in computer science, I compensate with a lifetime training in discovering and self-learning new things as well as adapting quickly to new situations and roles, which I believe to be core skills of being a developer. I also consider myself as being adaptable, determined, resilient, rigorous and details oriented.
