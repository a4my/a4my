  <summary> <b>About&nbsp;Me&nbsp;ℹ️&nbsp;</b></summary>
  <br/>

I began my journey as a musician and guitar teacher, dedicating a decade to performing with a vibrant rock band in London. Alongside my musical endeavors, I explored diverse career paths in food retail, finance, customer service, and sales, taking on roles ranging from management to salesmanship and customer support.

In late 2019, driven by a desire for a fresh challenge, creative exploration, and the pursuit of new knowledge, I made the pivotal decision to transition from music and sales to software and web development.

My journey commenced in May 2020, as I embarked on part-time studies after work and during weekends. A year later, I took the bold step of leaving my job to fully immerse myself in software and web development.

Fast forward to March 2022, and I secured my first position as a junior developer at PageSuite in Ashford. there, I delved into a spectrum of technologies, including Angular, Sencha Touch, C#, and AWS, while continuously enhancing my skills.

Today, as of August 2023, I'm thrilled to be part of the dynamic team at Everyone TV in London, where I engage with Javascript, Typescript and React on a daily basis, contributing to exciting projects and my ongoing growth in the world of software and web development.

Initially, my primary focus was on mastering HTML, CSS, Sass, and JavaScript. However, as I delved deeper into my studies, I found myself drawn towards a broader spectrum of technologies. This journey kindled a genuine passion for both frontend and backend development, igniting my enthusiasm for technologies such as React, NodeJS, APIs, and the comprehensive MERN stack as a whole.

During my free time, I'm actively engaged in crafting MERN projects and websites, applying the knowledge I gain daily at work and in my self-guided study sessions. I'm currently in the final stages of developing an Instagram clone, which I initiated from the ground up. This project leverages technologies such as React, Next.js, Firebase, Tailwind.css, and more, and I'm excited to see it come to fruition in the near future!
