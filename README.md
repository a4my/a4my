## Hi there, bonjour, buenos días, こんにちは! 👋

### About me ℹ️
Currently studying web development and planning on applying for my first role in the tech world as a junior developper in early 2022. I started studying web development part-time, after work and during my weekends, in May 2020. A year later, I quit my job to study web development full time.

Originally, I started out as a musician and a guitar teacher, and I played in a relatively busy rock band for 10 years. During my years in this band, I also worked in food retail, finance, customer service and sales either as a manager, a salesman or as a customer and support advisor.

After turning for good the music chapter of my life at the end of 2019, the need for a careeer change, creativity and learning new things led me to studying web development.

### What I've been studying 🌱
At first I wanted to focus on studying HTML, CSS, Sass and JavaScript, but the more I was learning the more I discovered new things and developed a genuine interest for frontend and backend technologies such as React, NodeJS, APIs and the MERN stack in general. 

### What I'm currently working on 🔨
In order to apply for my first role as a junior developer soon, I'm currently working on my own website to list all the projects I've created. I'm also building a few more MERN projects to include on my portfolio and website, and I'm hoping to finish working very soon on the social media app I've been building! 

### Why I should be considered as a candidate 🙂
Despite not having a degree in computer science nor any professional experience in this field yet, I compensate with a lifetime training in discovering and self-learning new things as well as adapting quickly to new roles which seems to be a core skill of being a web developer. I also praise myself as being adaptable, determined, resilient, rigorous and details and processes oriented.

Finally, I'm used to working remotely or on site, on my own or as part of a team and I'm happy to relocate to anywhere in the UK to better suit the needs of a role.
