## Hi there, bonjour, buenos días, こんにちは! 👋

### About me ℹ️
Currently studying web development and planning on applying for my first role in the tech world as a junior developper in early 2022 (wish me luch 🤞) I started studying web development part-time, after work and during my weekends, in May 2020. A year later, I quit my job to study web development full time.

Originally, I started out as a musician and a guitar teacher, and I played in a relatively busy rock band for 10 years. During my years in this band, I've also worked in food retail, finance, customer service and sales either as a manager, a salesman or as a customer and support advisor.

After turning for good the music chapter of my life at the end of 2019, the need for creativity and learning new things led me to studying web development.
